# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset through statistical summaries and visualizations. The goal is to understand the underlying patterns, distributions, relationships, and anomalies in the data.

## 📝 Objectives

1. **Generate Summary Statistics**

   * Compute basic descriptive statistics such as **mean**, **median**, **standard deviation**, **minimum**, **maximum**, and **percentiles** for all numeric features.

2. **Visualize Distributions**

   * Create **histograms** to visualize the distribution of numeric features.
   * Generate **boxplots** to detect outliers and understand the spread of data.

3. **Analyze Feature Relationships**

   * Use **pairplots** to explore interactions between numeric features.
   * Generate a **correlation matrix** and visualize it using a **heatmap** to detect linear relationships between variables.

4. **Identify Patterns and Anomalies**

   * Highlight any noticeable **trends**, **clusters**, or **outliers** based on statistical analysis and visual inspections.

5. **Draw Feature-Level Inferences**

   * Use the insights from the visuals and statistics to make basic **interpretations** about feature importance, potential data preprocessing needs, and feature engineering opportunities.

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualizations
* Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts
